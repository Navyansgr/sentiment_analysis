# 📢 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on *analyzing sentiments* from text data using *Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text as **positive, negative, or neutral* using machine learning models.  

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of *text reviews/tweets* labeled with sentiment categories:  
- *Positive* 😊  
- *Negative* 😠  
- *Neutral* 😐  

It contains real-world user opinions extracted from *Twitter, IMDB reviews, or product feedback*.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools  
- *Programming Language:* Python 🐍  
- *Libraries Used:*  
  - pandas – Data preprocessing  
  - numpy – Numerical operations  
  - matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization  
  - NLTK & TextBlob – Text preprocessing  
  - Scikit-Learn – Machine learning models  
  - TF-IDF Vectorizer – Feature extraction  
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM (optional) – Model training  

## 🔍 Steps in the Project  
1️⃣ *Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:* Removing stopwords, punctuation, and tokenizing text.  
2️⃣ *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Visualizing sentiment distribution.  
3️⃣ *Feature Engineering:* Using *TF-IDF and Word Embeddings*.  
4️⃣ *Model Training:* Training classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).  
5️⃣ *Evaluation:* Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- *Logistic Regression performed best with ~85% accuracy.*  
- *TF-IDF and Word Embeddings improved model performance.*  
- *Deep learning (LSTM) worked well on large datasets.*  

## 📌 How to Run the Project?  
1️⃣ Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn
